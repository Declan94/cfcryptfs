## About

Cfcryptfs is an extensible encrypted filesystem implemented on FUSE (Filesystem in User Space) for linux, 
inspired by some excellent ideas from [gocryptfs](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs), [encfs](https://github.com/vgough/encfs) and [securefs](https://github.com/netheril96/securefs)
